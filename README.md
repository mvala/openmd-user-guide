# OpenMD User Guide
[OpenMD](http://openmd.org) is an open source molecular dynamics engine which is capable of efficiently simulating liquids, proteins, nanoparticles, interfaces, and other complex systems. The book is meant to be for beginers (like me), who didn't work with any similar software.

## Prerequisites

I assume that [OpenMD](http://openmd.org) is installed and reader has read [OpenMD manual](http://openmd.org/?page_id=22).
